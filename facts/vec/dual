<li>
There exists a natural isomorphism from a vector space to its
double dual:
\[V\simeq V^{**}.\]

[explanation]
</summary>
Define the evaluation map \(\Gamma_v:V^*\to\mathbf F\)
via \(\phi\mapsto\phi(v)\). Then the map \(\Psi:V\to V^{**}\) given
by \(v\mapsto\Gamma_v\) is an isomorphism of vector spaces.
