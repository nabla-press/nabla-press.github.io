Given a basis \(\{e_1,\dots,e_n\}\) of a vector space \(V\),
there is exactly one way to express any \(v\in V\) as a
linear combination of the \(e_i\).

Recall that a basis of \(V\)
is a linearly independent set that spans \(V\).
Let \(v\in V\). Then since \(\Span(\{e_i\}) = V\),
there is at least one way to express \(v\) as a linear combination
of the \(e_i\). To see that there is at most one way to express
\(v\) as a linear combination of the \(e_i\),
let \(v = \sum_i\alpha_ie_i = \sum_i\beta_ie_i.\)
Then
\[\sum_i(\alpha_i - \beta_i)e_i = 0,\]
which implies \(\alpha_i -\beta_i = 0\), hence \(\alpha_i = \beta_i\).
