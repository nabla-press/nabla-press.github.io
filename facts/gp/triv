The <b>trivial group</b> is the set
\(\{\id_G\}\) with the operation \(\circ(\id_G, \id_G)
= \id_G\circ\id_G = \id_G\).
</p>
<p>
This forms a group.

We check the definition:
<ol>
<li>
Associativity of \(\circ\):
\(\id_G\circ(\id_G\circ\id_G)
= \id_G\circ\id_G
= (\id_G\circ\id_G)\circ\id_G\).
</li>
<li>
Identity: \(\id_G = \id_G\circ\id_G = \id_G\).
</li>
<li>
Inverses: \(\id_G = \id_G\circ\id_G = \id_G\).
