Consequences of the group definition. Let \(G\) be a group.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Since groups are monoids,
the identity element \(\id_G\) is unique.
</li>
<li>
Let \(g\in G\). Then \(g\) has a unique inverse.
<details>

Suppose \(h\) and \(k\) were inverses of \(g\).
Then
\[h = h\circ\id_G = h\circ(g\circ k)
= (h\circ g)\circ k = \id_G\circ k = k.\]

Let \(g\in G\). The map \(\ell_g:G\to G\) given by
\(\ell_g(h) = g\circ h\) is a bijection.
<details>
<summary>
[explanation]
</summary>
To show \(\ell_g\) is injective,
suppose \(\ell_g(h) = \ell_g(k)\).
Then \(g\circ h = g\circ k\),
hence \(g\inv\circ (g\circ h) = g\inv\circ (g\circ k)\),
hence \((g\inv\circ g)\circ h = (g\inv\circ g)\circ k\),
hence \(\id_G\circ h = \id_G\circ k\),
hence \(h = k\).
<br>
To show \(\ell_g\) is surjective, let \(h\in G\),
and let \(k = g\inv\circ h\). Then \[\ell_g(k) = g\circ (g\inv\circ h)
 = (g\circ g\inv)\circ h = \id_G\circ h = h.\]
Since \(\ell_g\) is both injective and surjective, it is also bijecitve.

Let \(g\in G\). The map \(r_g:G\to G\) given by
\(r_g(h) = h\circ g\) is a bijection.
<details>
<summary>
[explanation]
</summary>
To show \(r_g\) is injective, suppose \(r_g(h) = r_g(k)\).
Then \(h\circ g = k\circ g\),
hence \((h\circ g)\circ g\inv = (k\circ g)\circ g\inv\),
hence \(h\circ (g\circ g\inv) = k\circ (g\circ g\inv)\),
hence \(h\circ\id_G = k\circ\id_G\),
hence \(h = k\).
<br>
To show \(r_g\) is surjective,
let \(h\in G\), and let \(k = h\circ g\inv\).
Then
\[r_g(k) = (h\circ g\inv)\circ g = h\circ(g\inv\circ g)
= h\circ\id_G = h.\]
Since \(r_g\) is both injective and surjective, it is also bijecitve.
