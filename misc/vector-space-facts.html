The following are easy consequences of the
<a knowl="defs/vector-space.html">vector space axioms</a>:
<ol>
<li>
The origin 0 is unique.
<details>
<summary>
[explanation]
</summary>
Suppose \(0'\) is another origin. Then
\(0 = 0 + 0' = 0'\).
</details>
</li>
<li>
Every \(v\in V\) has a unique additive inverse (denoted \(-v\)).
<details>
<summary>
[explanation]
</summary>
Suppose \(w\) and \(w'\) are additive inverses of $v$. Then
\[w = w + 0 = w + (v + w') = (w + v) + w' = 0 + w' = w'.\]
</details>
</li>
<li>
The additive cancellation law holds: \(\forall u, v, w\in V\) we have
\[u + w = v + w \implies u = v.\]
<details>
<summary>
[explanation]
</summary>
By direct computation:
\[\begin{align*}
u &= u + 0 = u + (w + (-w)) = (u + w) + (-w)\\
&= (v + w) + (-w) = v + (w + (-w)) = v + 0 = v.
\end{align*}
\]
</details>
</li>
<li>
We have \(0v = 0\) for every \(v\in V\).
<details>
<summary>
[explanation]
</summary>
Computing, we find
\[0 + 0v = 0v = (0 + 0)v = 0v + 0v\]
so the result follows from the additive cancellation law.
</details>
</li>
<li>
We have \(\alpha 0 = 0\) for every \(\alpha\in\mathbf F\).
<details>
<summary>
[explanation]
</summary>
Computing, we find
\[0 + \alpha 0 = \alpha(0 + 0) = \alpha 0 + \alpha 0\]
so the result follows from the additive cancellation law.
</details>
</li>
<li>
We have \((-1)v = -v\) for every \(v\in V\).
<details>
<summary>
[explanation]
</summary>
By direct computation:
\[\begin{align*}
(-1)v &= (-1)v + 0 = (-1)v + (v + (-v))\\
&= (-1)v + (1v + (-v)) = ((-1)v + 1v) + (-v)\\
&= (-1 + 1)v + (-v) = 0v + (-v) = 0 + (-v) = -v
\end{align*}\]
</details>
</li>
<li>
We have \(\alpha v = 0\) implies either \(\alpha = 0\) or \(v = 0\).
<details>
<summary>
[explanation]
</summary>
Suppose \(\alpha v = 0\) and that \(\alpha\ne 0\). Then 
\[v = 1v = (\alpha^{-1}\alpha)v
= \alpha^{-1}(\alpha v) = \alpha^{-1}0 = 0.\]
