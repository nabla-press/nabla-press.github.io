The following are consequences of the <a knowl="defs/field.html">field axioms</a>:
<ol>
<li>
The additive identity 0 and multiplicative identity 1 are unique.
<details>
<summary>
[explanation]
</summary>
Suppose \(0'\) is another additive identity. Then
\(0 = 0 + 0' = 0'\).
<br/>
Similarly, suppose \(1'\) is another multiplicative identity. Then
\(1 = 11' = 1'\).
</details>
</li>
<li>
Every \(a\in F\) has a unique additive inverse (denoted \(-a\)),
<details>
<summary>
[explanation]
</summary>
Suppose \(b\) and \(b'\) are both additive inverses of \(a\).
Then 
\[b = b + 0 = b + (a + b') = (b + a) + b' = 0 + b' = b'.\]
</details>
and every
nonzero \(b\in F\) has a unique multiplicative inverse (denoted \(b^{-1}\)).
<details>
<summary>
[explanation]
</summary>
Suppose \(b\) and \(b'\) are both multiplicative inverses of \(a\).
Then 
\[b = b1 = b(ab') = (ba)b' = 1b' = b'.\]
</details>
</li>
<li>
The additive cancellation law holds: \(\forall a, b, c\in F\) we have
\[a + c = b + c \implies a = b.\]
<details>
<summary>
[explanation]
</summary>
By direct computation:
\[
\begin{align*}
a &= a + 0 = a + (c + (-c)) = (a + c) + (-c)\\
&= (b + c) + (-c) = b + (c + (-c)) = b + 0 = b.
\end{align*}
\]
</details>
<li>
The multiplicative cancellation law holds: \(\forall a, b, c\in F\) we have
\[ac = bc\;\;\text{and}\;\; c\ne 0\implies a = b.\]
<details>
<summary>
[explanation]
</summary>
Suppose \(ac = bc\) and \(c\ne 0\). Then \(c\) has a multiplicative inverse,
and thus 
\[a = a1 = a(cc^{-1}) = (ac)c^{-1} = (bc)c^{-1} = b(cc^{-1}) = b1 = b.\]
</details>
</li>
<li>
Zero annihilates all elements of \(F\):
\(\forall a\in F\) we have \(0a = 0\).
<details>
<summary>
[explanation]
</summary>
Note that 
\(0 + 0a = 0a = (0 + 0)a = 0a + 0a\), so by the additive cancellation
law we have \(0a = 0\).
</details>
</li>
<li>
We have \(-a = (-1)a\) for all \(a\in F\).
<details>
<summary>
[explanation]
</summary>
By direct computation:
\[
\begin{align*}
-a &= -a + 0 = -a + 0a\\
&= -a + (1 + (-1))a = -a + (1a + (-1)a)\\
&= (-a + 1a) + (-1)a = (-a + a) + (-1)a = 0 + (-1)a = (-1)a.
\end{align*}\]
</details>
</li>
<li>We have \(ab = 0\) if and only if either \(a = 0\) or \(b = 0\).
<details>
<summary>
[explanation]
</summary>
For the first direction, suppose \(ab = 0\) and \(a\ne 0\). Then
\(a\) has a multiplicative inverse, and so
\[b = 1b = (a^{-1}a)b = a^{-1}(ab) = a^{-1}0 = 0.\]
For the second direction, suppose either \(a = 0\) or \(b = 0\).
If \(a = 0\), then \(ab = 0b = 0\), while if 
\(b = 0\), then \(ab = 0a = 0\). So, either way, \(ab = 0\).
