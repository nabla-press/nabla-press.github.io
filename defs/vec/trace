Let \(T\in\End(V)\) be a linear map.
The <b>trace</b> of \(T\) is defined as follows
(expressing composition explicitly for clarity):
\[\tr\,T = \ev\circ(T\otimes\id_{V^*})\circ\coev(1).\]
If we express the coevaluation map in terms of the standard basis
\(\{e_i\}_{i=1}^n\) and the dual basis \(\{\pi^i\}_{i=1}^n\),
we get
\[\tr\,T = \ev\left(\sum_{i=1}^nTe_i\otimes\pi^i\right)
= \sum_{i=1}^n\pi^iTe_i.\]
