<i>Subspaces have a universal property:</i>
</p>
<p>
For any subspace \(U\) of \(V\) there exists
an injective inclusion map
\(\iota: U\to V\)
given by
\[\iota u = u\]
for all \(u\in U\).
</p>
<p>
If \(W\) is any vector space and \(T:W\to V\) is
a linear map such that \(T(W)\subseteq U\), then there exists
a unique linear map \(\widetilde T:W\to U\)
such that \(T = \iota\widetilde T\).

[explanation]
</summary>
<p>
Consider the map \(\widetilde Tw = Tw\).
</p>
<p>
It is well defined, and linear due to linearity of \(T\).
</p>
<p>
We have
\[\iota\widetilde Tw = \iota Tw = Tw.\]
</p>
<p>
Finally, if \(\widetilde T'\) is another linear map
such that \(\iota\widetilde T'w = Tw\), then
we have \(\widetilde T'w = Tw\),
hence \(\widetilde T'w = \widetilde Tw\),
which shows uniqueness.
