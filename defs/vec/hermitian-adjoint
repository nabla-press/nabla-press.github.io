Let \(T:V\to W\) be a linear map where \(V\) and \(W\)
are both inner product spaces.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Hermitian adjoint</b> of \(T\) is the unique linear map
\(T^\dagger : W\to V\) such that
\[\langle Tx, y\rangle_W = \langle x, T^\dagger y\rangle_V.\]
for all \(x\in V\) and \(y\in W\).
</p>
<p>
If \(\rho_V:V\to V^*\) and \(\rho_W:W\to W^*\) denote
the antilinear bijectins produced by the Riesz representation theorem,
then \[\rho_VT^\dagger = T^*\rho_W\] as linear maps,
where \(T^*:W^*\to V^*\) is the
<a knowl="defs/vec/dual-map">dual map</a> of \(T\).
