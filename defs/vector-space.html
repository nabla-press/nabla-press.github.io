A <b>vector space</b> (over a <a knowl="defs/field.html">field</a> \(\mathbf F\)) is a set \(V\) with:
<ul>
<li>
a special element 0 (called the <i>origin</i>),
</li>
<li>
an operation \(+:V^2\to V\)
given by \((a, b)\mapsto a + b\) (called <i>vector addition</i>),
</li>
<li>
an action \(\mathbf F\times V\to V\)
given by \((\lambda, v)\mapsto \lambda v\)
(called <i>scalar multiplication</i>),
</li>
</ul>
satisfying the following axioms:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Vector addition is associative: \(\forall a, b, c\in V\)
we have \(a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c\).
</li>
<li>
The origin is an additive identity:
\(\forall a\in V\), we have \(a + 0 = a = 0 + a\).
</li>
<li>
Additive inverses exist:
\(\forall a\in V\), we have \(a + b = 0 = b + a\) for some \(b\in F\).
</li>
<li>
Vector addition is commutative: \(\forall a, b\in V\)
we have \(a + b = b + a\).
</li>
<br/>
<li>
We have \(1v = v\) for all \(v\in V\).
</li>
<li>
We have \(\alpha(\beta v) = (\alpha\beta)v\) for all \(\alpha,\beta\in\mathbf F\)
and \(v\in V\).
</li>
<br/>
<li>
Scalar multiplication distributes over vector addition:
for all \(\alpha,\beta\in\mathbf F\) and \(u, v\in V\) we have
\[\alpha(u + v) = \alpha u + \alpha v\qquad\text{and}\qquad
(\alpha + \beta)v = \alpha v + \beta v.\]
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Elements of \(V\) are called <b>vectors</b>,
whereas elements of \(\mathbf F\) are called <b>scalars</b>.
