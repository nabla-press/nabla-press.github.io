A <b>monoid</b> is a <a knowl="defs/gp/semigroup">semigroup</a>
\((M, \circ)\) with an element \(\def\id{\text{id}}\id_G\),
called an <b>identity element</b>, such that
\[g\circ\id_G = g = \id_G\circ g\]
for all \(g\in G\).
</p>
<p>
The identity element \(\id_G\) is unique.

Suppose there
were another identity element \(\widetilde\id_G\). Then
\[\widetilde\id_G = \widetilde\id_G\circ\id_G = \id_G.\]
